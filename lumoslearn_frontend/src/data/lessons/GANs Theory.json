  "content": "<b>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b> are a powerful class of neural networks introduced by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014. They are designed for <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">generative modeling</span>, meaning they can learn to generate new data instances that resemble the training data.<br><br>A GAN consists of two competing neural networks:<br><i>1. <b>Generator (G):</b></i> This network takes random noise as input and tries to <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">generate new data</span> (e.g., images, text) that looks as real as possible.<br><i>2. <b>Discriminator (D):</b></i> This network is a binary classifier that tries to <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">distinguish between real data</span> (from the training set) and fake data (generated by the Generator).<br><br>The two networks are trained simultaneously in a <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">zero-sum game</span>. The Generator tries to fool the Discriminator by producing increasingly realistic fake data, while the Discriminator tries to become better at identifying fake data. This adversarial process continues until the Generator creates data that the Discriminator can no longer reliably distinguish from real data (i.e., the Discriminator outputs 0.5 for both real and fake data).",
