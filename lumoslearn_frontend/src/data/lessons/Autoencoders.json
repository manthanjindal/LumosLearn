Its primary goal is to learn an efficient, compressed representation (encoding) of input data.<br><br>The architecture of an autoencoder consists of two main parts:<br><i>1. <b>Encoder:</b></i> This part takes the input data and transforms it into a lower-dimensional representation, often called the <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">latent space</span> or code. This process compresses the input information.<br><i>2. <b>Decoder:</b></i> This part takes the compressed representation from the encoder and reconstructs the original input data from it.<br><br>The network is trained by minimizing the <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">reconstruction error</span>, which is the difference between the original input and its reconstructed output. By forcing the network to reconstruct its own input, it learns a meaningful and compact representation of the data in the latent space. Autoencoders are commonly used for <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">dimensionality reduction, feature learning, anomaly detection</span>, and even for generating new data (when combined with generative models).",
