However, limitations such as the inability of single-layer perceptrons to solve non-linear problems (like XOR) led to an 'AI winter' in the 1980s.<br><br>The resurgence began in the late 1980s with the development of <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">backpropagation</span>, which allowed training of multi-layer neural networks. Despite this, computational power and data availability remained significant bottlenecks.<br><br>The true explosion of Deep Learning occurred in the <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">2000s and 2010s</span>, driven by:<br><i>1. Vastly increased computational power (especially GPUs).<br>2. Availability of massive datasets.<br>3. Development of new algorithms and architectures (e.g., ReLU, CNNs, RNNs).</i><br><br>Landmark achievements like AlexNet's success in image recognition in 2012 cemented Deep Learning's position as a dominant force in AI.",
