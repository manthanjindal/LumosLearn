  "title": "Clustering",
  "content": "<b>Clustering</b> is an unsupervised learning task that involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. The goal is to discover the natural groupings in the data without any prior knowledge of the categories.<br><br>Imagine you have a dataset of customers, and you want to segment them into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. Clustering can help you identify these segments, such as \"high-spending loyal customers,\" \"budget-conscious shoppers,\" and \"occasional buyers.\" This information can then be used for targeted marketing campaigns.<br><br>Common clustering algorithms include:<br><i>1. <b>K-Means Clustering</b></i><br><i>2. <b>Hierarchical Clustering</b></i><br><i>3. <b>DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)</b></i>",
