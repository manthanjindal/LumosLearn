  "title": "Your First ML Model",
  "content": "Your First ML Model is a crucial step in practical AI learning. This involves understanding the basics of machine learning, selecting appropriate algorithms, and implementing a complete model. Key steps include data collection and preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. Common first projects include image classification, sentiment analysis, or simple prediction tasks. The process teaches important concepts like feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. Building your first model helps develop practical skills and understanding of the ML workflow.",
