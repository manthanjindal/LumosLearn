  "content": "<b>Feature Engineering</b> is the art and science of creating new features from existing data to improve model performance. It requires domain knowledge and creativity to extract meaningful signals that can help your model make better predictions. This is often one of the most impactful parts of the machine learning workflow.<br><br>For example, if you have a dataset of customer transactions, you could create new features like \"average purchase value,\" \"purchase frequency,\" or \"time since last purchase.\" These engineered features can provide valuable insights that are not immediately obvious from the raw data.<br><br>Common feature engineering techniques include:<br><i>1. <b>Creating Interaction Terms:</b></i> Combining two or more features to capture their interaction.<br><i>2. <b>Binning:</b></i> Converting continuous numerical data into categorical bins.<br><i>3. <b>Transformations:</b></i> Applying mathematical functions like log or square root to a feature to change its distribution.<br><i>4. <b>Encoding Categorical Variables:</b></i> Converting text-based categories into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.",
