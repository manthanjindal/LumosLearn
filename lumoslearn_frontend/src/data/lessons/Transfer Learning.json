  "title": "Transfer Learning",
  "content": "<b>Transfer Learning</b> is a machine learning technique where a model developed for a task is <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">reused as the starting point for a model on a second task</span>. It's particularly effective in Deep Learning, where training models from scratch can be computationally expensive and require vast amounts of data.<br><br>The core idea is that knowledge gained from solving one problem can be applied to a different but related problem. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of images (like ImageNet) to classify objects has learned to extract general features (edges, textures, shapes) that are useful for many other computer vision tasks.<br><br>Common approaches in transfer learning:<br><i>1. <b>Feature Extraction:</b></i> Using a pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor. The pre-trained convolutional base (for CNNs) is kept, and only a new classifier is trained on top of it.<br><i>2. <b>Fine-tuning:</b></i> Unfreezing some or all layers of the pre-trained model and retraining them with a very small learning rate on the new dataset. This allows the model to adapt its learned features to the specific nuances of the new task.<br><br>Benefits include <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">reduced training time, less data requirement</span> for the new task, and often better performance.",
