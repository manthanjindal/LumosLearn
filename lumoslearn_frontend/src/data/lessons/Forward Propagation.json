  "title": "Forward Propagation",
  "content": "<b>Forward propagation</b> (or forward pass) is the process where input data is fed through the neural network, layer by layer, to produce an output.<br><br>It's the first step in the training process and also how a trained network makes predictions. For each neuron in a layer, the following steps occur:<br><i>1. Each input from the previous layer is multiplied by its corresponding <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">weight</span>.</i><br><i>2. These weighted inputs are summed together.</i><br><i>3. A <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">bias</span> term is added to the sum.</i><br><i>4. The result is passed through an <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">activation function</span>.</i><br><br>This output then becomes the input for the neurons in the next layer, and the process continues until the data reaches the output layer, producing the network's final prediction. No learning or weight updates occur during forward propagation; it's purely about calculating the output based on current weights and biases.",
