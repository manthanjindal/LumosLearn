  "content": "Training a neural network is an <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">iterative process</span> where the network learns to map inputs to outputs by adjusting its internal parameters (weights and biases).<br><br>The typical training loop involves the following steps:<br><i>1. <b>Forward Pass:</b></i> Input data is fed through the network to produce predictions.<br><i>2. <b>Calculate Loss:</b></i> The loss function quantifies the error between the predictions and the actual target values.<br><i>3. <b>Backward Pass (Backpropagation):</b></i> The gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases are calculated.<br><i>4. <b>Parameter Update:</b></i> An <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">optimizer</span> (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam) uses these gradients to adjust the weights and biases in a direction that minimizes the loss.<br><br>This entire process is repeated for many <span style=\"color:#A3F7BF\">epochs</span>. An epoch represents one complete pass through the entire training dataset. The goal is for the network to converge to a state where the loss is minimized, and it can generalize well to unseen data.",
